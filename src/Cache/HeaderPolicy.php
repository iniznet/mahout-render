/**
 * The response policy, derived from the declared cacheability class and the
 * request state. The caching contract's derivation is the authority: the
 * three class rows are verbatim, and a reduction stricter than the
 * declaration always wins.
 *
 * The full 3 x 6 table — anonymous in range, logged in, state-changing
 * method, out-of-range page, free-text search, engaged error boundary — is
 * asserted cell by cell by the policy's test. At send-headers time four of
 * the six inputs exist (method, logged-in, out-of-range page, free-text
 * search); the error cell's runtime seam is the Error Surface's 500, which
 * is sent after the header phase and carries no validator of its own.
